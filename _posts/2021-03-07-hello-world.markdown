I couldn't think of a cornier way to start this first post. This is what 2 braincells at 12:42 in the morning accomplishes and yes I am proud of myself.

To simply put it in illustrate, I feel like a cross between:

The **important** thing today is that it marks a new era. The beginning of this blog. Or maybe the end of me as we know it. We'll see. Stay tuned.
